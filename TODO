For next 3.0.0 release:

- https://github.com/calaos/calaos_base/issues?state=open

- Translation! At least in english/french
- Update calaos_installer accordingly (there are some missing IO in calaos_installer like AVRs)
- Maybe add some versionning info in config files (io/rules xml)

Less important for next release:
- Test and finish the datalogguer
- Finish the graph visualizer/dataloguer on the web UI
- Find a way to display graphs in calaos_home
- Add InputScript/OutputScript to let user write Lua scripts to handle not supported hardware easily
- Add some example/docs for Lua scripts and maybe add nice helpers/docs directly in calaos_installer script editor
- Make calaos_installer aware of unkown IO types and handle them correctly (display a unkown type)
  Also save them again to the file so the io.xml file is not corrupted
- Calaos Installer need a debugger-like to auto-correct and display mistakes in rules.xml/io.xml (if the user did some
  wrong rules like loops, or using the same io at the same time in mutiple exclusive rules, ...)

The following list has no priority...

- Add some more smart heating controls/management, like an automatic rule/action to handle
  all heating automatically. Like a function block where you give a temp sensor + an output contact for
  heat control + some time range and all the heat control is done automatically without having to write
  100+ rules.
- Maybe do the same thing for other case (light control or shutters) to remove a bit the complexity of rules programming
  for newbies.
- Add support for zwave devices (see http://code.google.com/p/open-zwave/)
- Add support for Flukso (see https://www.flukso.net/)
- Add support for OpenEnergyMonitor (http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/)
- Add a way to display and record graph of temperature or other metering device
- Add support for BlyssBox products (see: https://github.com/skywodd/arduino_blyss_hack/)
- Maybe support jeenode to get metering data? (http://jeelabs.com/products/jeenode)
